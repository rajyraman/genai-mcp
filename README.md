# GenAIScript MCP Demo üöÄ

This repository demonstrates the MCP Server capabilities of GenAIScript. The minimum version you need is `1.119.4`

## What is GenAIScript? ü§ñ

GenAIScript is a framework that enables you to communicate with AI models (even local models). GenAIScript can use MCP tools, and can also act as the MCP server.

## Model Context Protocol (MCP) üìã

This is how Anthropic, the creators of MCP specification, defines [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/introduction)

> MCP is an open protocol that standardizes how applications provide context to LLMs. Think of MCP like a USB-C port for AI applications. Just as USB-C provides a standardized way to connect your devices to various peripherals and accessories, MCP provides a standardized way to connect AI models to different data sources and tools.

## Installation of GenAIScript üõ†Ô∏è

Install the VSCode extension. You need at least Node.js v20. Refer to https://microsoft.github.io/genaiscript/getting-started/installation/ additional instructions. 

## Usage üíª

If you install the March 2025 version of VSCode Insiders, you should be able to run the GenAIScript MCP server locally, to get the tool versions installed on your local machine.

[mcp.json](./.vscode/mcp.json) is where you would configure the MCP servers. Below is the sample configuration on Windows.

```json
{
    "servers": {
        "genaiscript": {
            "type": "stdio",
            "command": "cmd",//Have run like this in Windows. Otherwise ENOENT for npx, atleast in my machine.
            "args": [
                "/c",
                "npx",
                "-y",
                "genaiscript",
                "mcp",
                "--cwd",
                "${workspaceFolder}",
                "--groups",
                "mcp"
            ],
            "env": {
                "DEBUG": "*"
            }
            // "envFile": "${workspaceFolder}/.env"
        }
    }
}
```
You can start the MCP Server by clicking the Start link. If it is already running, you would see a Running indicator.
